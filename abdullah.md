*Software Engineer @ Raytheon Missiles and Defense | Graduating CS Student @ GWU*

I am a computer science major at George Washington University with a passion for software development and data science. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as C and Java, I have experience in developing web applications, data visualization and machine learning. My goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer and data scientist with a focus on improving the lives of people through technology. I am an incoming software engineer at Raytheon Missiles and Defense, where I will be working on state-of-the-art technology in defense and aerospace systems.

I have experience working in teams, collaborating with peers and mentoring juniors. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn, grow and make an impact. During my free time, I enjoy reading about new technologies and experimenting with them. I am also an avid learner and love to read about new things.

I am always open to discussing new opportunities and networking with professionals in the industry. Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to connect or have any questions.

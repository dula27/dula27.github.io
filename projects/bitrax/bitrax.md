# Project Title: Bitrax - Personalized Stock & Crypto Watchlist App
# Project Description
Bitrax is a user-friendly mobile app designed to help investors stay up-to-date with real-time market data and easily manage their stock and cryptocurrency watchlists. The app integrates with Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage API, and Firebase Auth to provide users with a seamless experience.

Upon launching the app, users can sign up or log in with their Firebase Auth credentials. Once logged in, they can start creating their personalized stock and crypto watchlists, by simply searching for tickers and adding them to their list. The app stores the watchlist in the user's Firebase database, making it easy to access from any device.

One of the key features of Bitrax is the ability to view market data in real-time. When a user searches for a ticker, the app uses the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve the latest market data, including price, price change, high, low, open price, closing price, and volume. Additionally, the app generates a graph of the stock prices, allowing users to visualize the performance of the stock over a specified period.

Other features of the Bitrax app include the ability to view news articles related to each stock or crypto, and the ability to set price alerts. Users can choose to receive alerts when a stock or crypto reaches a specific price point, making it easier to make informed trading decisions.

The Bitrax app is built using modern mobile development technologies, including Android Studio, Kotlin, and Firebase. The app leverages the Yahoo Finance API and Alpha Vantage API to retrieve real-time market data and news articles, respectively. Firebase Auth is used to securely manage user authentication, while Firebase Realtime Database is used to store and retrieve user watchlists.
